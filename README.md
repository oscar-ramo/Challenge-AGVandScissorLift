# Challenge - AGV and ScissorLift
This repository contains my contributions to the project, along with the final technical report submitted to the supervising professors, which documents the design, implementation, and results of the work.

The project lasted 15 weeks, during which:
- Week 1 - 5: The project management and organization were made, and a static analysis was conducted to calculate how much force the Scissor Lift's joints would receive
