# Challenge - AGV and ScissorLift
This repository contains my contributions to the project, along with the final technical report submitted to the supervising professors, which documents the design, implementation, and results of the work.

The project lasted 15 weeks, during which:
- Week 1 - 5: The project management and organization were made, and a static analysis was conducted to calculate how much force the Scissor Lift's joints would receive
- Week 6 - 10: The CAD design was made to later manufacture both the AGV and Scissor Lift.
- Week 11 - 15: The electronic schematic with its connections and the final programming was made

## Weeks 1 - 5
My contributions during this week was the static analysis calculations. The idea was that two members made this to compare results and select the best approach. I was one of the two members that made the calculations, and while at the end we decided to use
